Available quarterly for the past few years.

### Code - Trip data

                        format = "csv")
ds.set_option("file-entry", "Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1.csv")

ds.load_sample(100)    # or   ds.load() for all the data
ds.print_description()

id = ds.fetch_random("trip_id")
time = ds.fetch_random("start_time")   # note: subsequence 'fetch_random's will fetch from the 
user = ds.fetch_random("usertype")     #       *same* row of data as the first one (trip_id)
dur = ds.fetch_random_int("tripduration")

print("Trip", id, "was made by a", user, "at", time, "and lasted for a duration of", (dur//60), "minutes")
