**Sinbad** is a software library for Java and Python that makes it very easy to uniformly access online data sources provided in standard formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

If you are a novice programmer, you probably should go through the [tutorials](#tutorials) below after installing Sinbad. Experienced programmers may benefit more from the [quick start guides](#quick-start). You will also find links to a [quick reference](#quick-reference) and detailed [API documentation](#api-reference) below.
