**Sinbad** is a software library for Java and Python that makes it very easy to uniformly access online data sources provided in standard formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

If you are a novice programmer, you probably should go through the [tutorials](#tutorials) below after installing Sinbad. Experienced programmers may benefit more from the [quick start guides](#quick-start). You will also find links to a [quick reference](#quick-reference) and detailed [API documentation](#api-reference) below.

## Installation
Instructions for:
* [Java](install-java)
* [Python](install-python)
* [Racket](install-racket)

## Quick Start
These links provide a concise introduction to the most prominent features of the Sinbad library. Use these if you are experienced in the programming language that you are using:

* [Java](quick-start-java)
* [Python](quick-start-python)
* [Racket](quick-start-racket)

## Tutorials
These pages provide a more leisurely and explanatory coverage of the features of the Sinbad library in the respective language. These are good if you are learning to program for the first time and are interested in using Sinbad to access data.
